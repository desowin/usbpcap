USBPcap is looking for fiscal sponsor
-------------------------------------

Fiscal sponsorship is a formal arrangement in which a 501(c)(3) public charity sponsors a project that may lack exempt status. USBPcap has sent requests to join Software Freedom Conservacy and Software For Public Interest. So far no reply from either.
