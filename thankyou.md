This project was developed as part of master's thesis. See [donors](donors.html) page for non-development help.

Other ways to help include, but are not limited to, following:  

*   Writing documentation (perhaps chm file) that would be bundled with installer.
*   Fixing typos/grammar errors on USBPcap website.
*   Translating webpage into foreign languages.
